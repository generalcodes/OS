Professonal Operation System Simple Code Solution
With Maximized effort from AntUV

May you have noticed the greedy for profits-based corporations are no longer holding business ethic standards as the old days. Fast, faster, and fastest. Profits, profits, and profits. In the old days, the creation is for humanity civilization, not, for group protection and benefits.
Think about the creation of language and recording, the we have print and paper. Harness energy from fossil with locomotion system. Release nuclear energy from fission and fusion. Nobody is trying to toll you from using it.
However, when a tiny company haired by IBM to create IBM PC-DOS 1.0, … gradually, software grows overwhelming over hardware in regarding of the life-cycle, profit margin, and many more. Entertainment devices overtook manufacturing machinery. The world is in a upside-down mode:
1)	Microsoft become the highest value company. Bad
2)	Internet bubble grew and burst. Virtual and not reliable.
3)	Google’s information value manipulations and success. Worse, in Microsoft eye*.
4)	Facebook, and Twitter, much worse. Declined human quality and more.
5)	iMac, Android, and the fading Windows
*Bill Gates 1994: "I see little commercial potential for the internet for the next 10 years"

Even though, the focus is on the operation system. Microsoft is bad, monopoly, still, it created its original code with absorbing varieties of sources and competitors. Apple OS was originally hybridized on BSD/Unix, this origin creates a w*o*e like life, firstly, fully exploit the all sort of resources and potential of the host, secondly, preventing others to fully understand and benefit from, on the surface, more makeups and polish for attractions. Till today, you will find it is very hard to make full potential on MAC system but suck from whatever they put on the table. I’d use a old Apple to do date acquisitions in Oak Ridge National Laboratory, although made big discovery on it, but the system stubborn interface sucked a lot, the only way you get the date out is from a floppy disk in Windows XP era.
Then Android, Linux kernel based. Essential MacOS w*o*e like. Same pattern, same problem: they f*** the users up from the beginning. You have very limited rights, they hid, shielded, and stripped away your access and prevented you from freely orientating the hardware system from beginning. If you check the current Android and MacOS, the eat up nearly 30 GB space out of your storage. And your ability to do something with it is very limit.
Enough said, the current systems are lousy and sloppy. AntUV is working effortless to create something that is neat, clean, tidy and efficient.

That is the background for this project and the introduction for this preface.

Next, a small enumeration on some of the smart code projects.
