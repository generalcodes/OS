# OS
Professonal Operation System Simple Code Solution

In many occasions we want a simple operation system to run for one reason or another, a portable fully functional OS, preferably runs in RAM independently without requiring accessing to system storage, is ideal for:
(1)	Do the try-outs dry-runs test-outs.
(2)	Virus study without worrying about own OS security.
(3)	Fundamental and essential hardware and system building.
And many more.
Here, are a few puzzles answered:
(1)	The smallest Windows GUI OS with modern disk storage support: SSD, USB, NTFS, etc.
(2)	The portable Windows fully functional OS with .Net, msi, install/uninstall, configurable.
(3)	LAN is not an issue now, preferably with portable WiFi support.
Through some efforts, Iâ€™ve provided these works and hope to help enthusiasts for their works.

is a good place for you to get in-depth information for each system.
