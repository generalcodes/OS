Windows solution get full file folder directory access privilege read write delete move copy change for access denied permission on protected system

*How to access "Command Prompt (Admin)", which Windows 10 initially hidden: Goto 1) "All Setting" 2) "Personalization" 3) "Taskbar" 4) Turn off "Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the start button or press Windows Key+X". Do not know how to access "All setting"? Ask Mom.

However, sometimes, this is not enough to totally clear the files/folders. In this essay, Ant is going to introduce a second utility command in windows, to suffice the del/delete/deletion conditions.

The command needed is: "icacls", still taking the example of "system volume information" folder:

icacls "system volume information" /reset /t

/reset Replaces Access Control List with default inherited ACLs for matching files.
/T Total: perform on all matching files/directories below specified one.

After this, there is no problem to operate on the identities, files, directories, folders, modify, move, deletion, change etc.
