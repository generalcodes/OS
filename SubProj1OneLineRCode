To try the code: Have R installed [require("rvest")]. Here is the total code line, # starting a comment and library("rvest") is like "include" in C
------R Code Starts after this line-------
library("rvest")
gsub("[\r\n]", "", html_text(html_nodes((read_html("https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump")), css = ".js-tweet-text-container"))[1:10])
------R Code Ends before this line-------
# Below is another version, less flexible, You may change the twitter user and the "1:10" to "1:####" to get the last #### tweets.
html_text(html_nodes((read_html("https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump")), css = ".js-tweet-text-container"),trim=TRUE)[1:10]
